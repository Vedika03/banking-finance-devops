FinanceMe ‚Äì DevOps Project (End-to-End CI/CD)
üìå Project Overview
FinanceMe is a Spring Boot‚Äìbased microservice that simulates a Banking Insurance Service. The project demonstrates a complete DevOps lifecycle, from application development to automated deployment, testing, and monitoring.
The implementation covers: - Microservice development - Containerization - CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins - Automated provisioning & configuration (Terraform + Ansible) - Automated testing (JUnit + Selenium) - Monitoring & visualization (Prometheus + Grafana)

‚úÖ Steps Implemented
1. Spring Boot Microservice
‚Ä¢	Implemented Account entity and AccountService
‚Ä¢	AccountController with CRUD APIs: create, update, view, delete
2. Database Integration
‚Ä¢	Configured application.properties for MySQL/RDS
‚Ä¢	H2 fallback considered for local testing
3. Unit Testing
‚Ä¢	TestNG tests written for service layer (TestAccountService.java)
‚Ä¢	mvn clean test executed successfully, reports generated
4. Docker
‚Ä¢	Dockerfile created
‚Ä¢	Docker image built (financeme-banking:latest)
‚Ä¢	Container deployed successfully
5. API Testing
‚Ä¢	All 4 APIs tested using curl
6. Jenkins ‚Äì CI/CD Pipeline
‚Ä¢	Jenkins installed & configured with Maven and Git
‚Ä¢	Pipeline stages:
1.	Checkout from GitHub
2.	Maven build & test
3.	Build Docker image
4.	Stop old container (if exists)
5.	Deploy new container
‚Ä¢	Successful execution end-to-end
7. Ansible ‚Äì Configuration Management
‚Ä¢	Playbook created to:
o	Install Docker on EC2
o	Remove old container
o	Deploy new container with financeme-banking:latest
8. Terraform ‚Äì Infrastructure as Code
‚Ä¢	Terraform used to provision AWS EC2 instances
‚Ä¢	Infra managed with terraform apply & terraform destroy
9. Selenium ‚Äì Automated Testing
‚Ä¢	Selenium tests created using ChromeDriver (headless)
‚Ä¢	Navigates to running app, validates title, captures screenshot
‚Ä¢	JUnit lifecycle (@BeforeAll, @Test, @AfterAll) implemented
10. Prometheus ‚Äì Monitoring
‚Ä¢	Installed & configured Prometheus
‚Ä¢	Metrics collected from Spring Boot app
‚Ä¢	Fixed YAML & systemd service configuration
11. Grafana ‚Äì Visualization
‚Ä¢	Installed Grafana and connected Prometheus datasource
‚Ä¢	Created custom dashboards with multiple panels (CPU, Memory, API metrics)
12. End-to-End Flow
‚Ä¢	Push code ‚Üí Jenkins pipeline runs ‚Üí Terraform creates infra ‚Üí Ansible deploys ‚Üí Docker app runs ‚Üí Selenium validates ‚Üí Prometheus scrapes metrics ‚Üí Grafana visualizes
‚Ä¢	Complete DevOps cycle achieved with one-click pipeline execution
